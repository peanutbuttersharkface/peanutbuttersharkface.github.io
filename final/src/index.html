          <h2>Welcome to Speed O Reader!</h2>
          <p>Speed O Reader was made to help anyone read quicker.  
            How this works is you enter a URL for the website that has the 
            information that you would like to read.  This will not work with
            websites that require a login.
          </p>
          <p>Next you pick your Fixation point, this is a number from 1 through 5.  The fixation
            number sets the number of letters in a word that are bold.   For example,
            if you were to pick number 1 about 75% of the word would be put in bold.  This is 
            where your eye would focus on and be able to figure out the word just by reading
            what is in bold.   If you were to pick the number 5 than about 25% of the word
            would be in bold.   Feel free to play around with this to see what is best for you.
          </p>
          <p>Lastly, you need to pick a Saccade number.  The numbers start at 10 and go up by 10's 
            until 50.  Saccade is rapid movement of you eyes from two different points, this sets
            the visual jumps from location to location by switching from different points of 
            interest.   The numbers prepresent how many words should have fixation points, 10
            meaning every word has a fixation point, 20 is every second word, 30 every third word 
            and so on.  This can also be played around with until you find what works for you.
          </p>
          <p>Good luck on your journey to faster reading.</p>
